    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>My name is Abigail Marie Scarborough. I am a student at Eastern Washington University completing my senior year. I am gaining my Bachelor of Arts degree in Technical Communication with a minor in Visual Communication Design. My intended graduation date is Summer 2017. I currently am employed at my university, where I work in the Theatre Department of Eastern Washington University. I am tasked with designing, building, and maintaining all costumes used for EWU theatre productions.</p>
    <p>Over my schooling, I have gained a strong passion for both writing and design. I hope to continue to excel in both these areas with the completion of my degree and professional experience as I move into the workforce post-graduation.</p>
    <p>I am very independently motivated and always meet deadlines. On the same note, I am also very capable of working in a team setting. I have writing expertise in areas of instructional, proposal, usability, and technical editing. Design wise, I am experience in user-based document design, publication design, and designing for communication. I am familiar with numerous technical writing and design programs; such as Adobe CC applications and MadCap Flare to name a few.</p>
    <p>I am 22 years old, and have lived in the small town of Nine Mile Falls, Washington all my life. I enjoy art, literature, baking, animal photography, and pet blogging.</p>
